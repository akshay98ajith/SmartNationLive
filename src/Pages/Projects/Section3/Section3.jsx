                  All violations from wearing a helmet at workplaces are
                  detected by AI and alert the HSE offices to rectify the
                  problem. Furthermore, it identifies helmet color and
                  reconciles them with the requirements of HSE for different
                  personnel. To protect employees from accidents, the HSE team
                  notifies the employees of any violations detected by the
                  system.

                <p>
                  Working at heights has become a standard part of the job in
                  many industries. But with height also comes a greater risk of
                  falling. A harness is an effective tool for protecting workers
                  from injury and death caused by falls. We can detect any
                  failure to wear PPE in defined safety zones such as those
                  involving work at height.

                <p>
                  Wearing a protective mask is a key part of a protection
                  program in chemical or biological environments. During the
                  COVID-19 pandemic, wearing masks extended to every crowded
                  place like public places, public transportation, and offices.
                  The PPE Regulation Scenario enables the HSE team to control
                  mask wear protocols backed by an AI engine.

                  Workers exposed to dust or flying particles, such as in
                  woodworking or who have to work around heat hazards, should
                  wear goggles. It is important to use this type of protection
                  in case of chemical splashes or vapors to prevent eye
                  injuries. We ensure there is proper supervision of goggles
                  wearing at dangerous sites with the necessary pre-defined
                  regulations

                  Different sites may require different regulations depending on
                  the work environment. And according to this regulation,
                  workers have to use a different set of personal protective
                  equipment. HSE managers can set up specific safety regulations
                  for each work at height site using our AI safety solution.

                  To prevent a company's employees from harm caused by lifting
                  risks such as falling objects, each lifting area needs to have
                  a safety guideline for PPE. We provide various scenarios for
                  different PPE requirements at the lifting area to protect
                  members of the lifting crew during the lifting operation.

                <p>
                  The wind can affect any size crane, whether it is an
                  all-terrain or crawler crane. Despite the fact that cranes
                  with counterweights weigh significantly more, a strong enough
                  wind can still cause catastrophic damage if not accounted for.
                  Wind speed can be monitored by our wind speed alert using
                  integrated wind speed sensors. If the wind speed exceeds a
                  safety threshold, we can abort the lifting operation.

                  It is up to the crane supervisor to direct and supervise any
                  lifting operation to ensure that it is carried out according
                  to the method statement. A competent and suitably trained
